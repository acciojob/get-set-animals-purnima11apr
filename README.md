# Get Set Animals

Create a class called `Animal` that has a constructor method that takes one argument: `species`. It should have a getter for species and a method called `makeSound()` that logs a sound the animal makes. Create a subclass called `Cat` that extends the Animal class. Add a method to the Cat class called `purr()` that logs `purr` to the console. Create a subclass called `Dog` that extends the Animal class. Add a method to the Dog class called `bark()` that logs `woof` to the console.
